                The Nissan GT-R, is a sports car and grand tourer produced by Nissan, unveiled in 2007. It is the 
            successor to the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a high-performance variant of the Nissan Skyline. The GT-R is an 
            entirely new model sharing little with the Nissan Skyline GT-R, except its signature four round tail lights. 
            Like some later generations of the Skyline GT-R, the GT-R has the ATTESA E-TS all-wheel drive system with a 
            twin-turbocharged 6-cylinder engine. But the HICAS four-wheel-steering system was removed and the former 
            straight-6 RB26DETT engine was replaced with the new VR38DETT engine. Despite the GT-R's heritage, the
            chassis code for the all-new version is CBA-R35 and for later model years DBA-R35 and 4BA-R35, or R35 for short 
            , carrying on the naming trend from previous Skyline GT-R generations. In 2019, for the 2020 model year, Nissan 
            updated the GT-R again with minor upgrades, such as a re-tuned transmission to shift gears in just 0.15 seconds, 
            a new lightweight forged aluminium alloy wheels, new interior and exterior colour options including the Bayside 
            Blue body colour which was used in the Skyline GT-R R34.

            <h1 id="supra" class="heading">Toyota Supra MK4</h1>
            <h1 id="h1">Overview</h1>
            <p id="para1">
            The Toyota Supra is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation beginning 
            in 1978. The name "supra" is derived from the Latin prefix, meaning "above", "to surpass" or "go beyond".
            The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been 
            produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019. The styling of the original Supra was derived from 
            the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider. Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate 
            model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra. Owing 
            to the similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. 
            The first, second and third generations of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, 
            while the fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The 5th generation of the 
            Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr. The Supra traces much of its 
            roots back to the 2000GT owing to an inline-6 layout. The first three generations were offered with a direct 
            descendant to the Crown's and 2000GT's M engine. Interior aspects were also similar, as was the chassis code "A".

            <h1 id="thar" class="heading">Mahindra Thar</h1>
            <h1 id="h1">Overview</h1>
            <p id="para1">
            The Thar was first introduced in 2010 as a modernized version of the Mahindra Legend, which was based 
            on the Mahindra MM540, a vehicle that was in production in India since the 1980s. The Mahindra Thar was 
            designed to be a rugged, reliable, and affordable off-road vehicle that could handle the rough terrain 
            found in many parts of India. The Thar's design is based on the iconic Jeep CJ series, which Mahindra 
            had been producing under license since the 1940s. The first generation Mahindra Thar was powered by a 
            2.5-liter turbocharged diesel engine that produced 105 horsepower and 247 Nm of torque. The vehicle was 
            available in two trim levels: the DI 2WD and the DI 4WD. In 2015, Mahindra introduced an updated version 
            of the Thar called the Thar CRDe. The CRDe stood for "common rail diesel engine," which was a more advanced 
            engine that produced 105 horsepower and 247 Nm of torque. In 2020, Mahindra introduced the second generation 
            Thar, which was a completely redesigned version of the vehicle. The Thar 2020 has a new, more modern design 
            that features a bold grille, LED headlights, and a hardtop roof. It is powered by either a 2.0-liter turbocharged 
            gasoline engine or a 2.2-liter turbocharged diesel engine, both of which are mated to either a six-speed manual or a 
            six-speed automatic transmission. The Thar 2020 also has new features, such as a touchscreen infotainment system, a 
            rearview camera, and an adventure statistics display. The Thar 2020 is available in two trim levels: the AX and the 
            LX, with the latter being the more premium option. The Mahindra Thar has been well-received by both off-road enthusiasts 
            and the general public in India. It has become a popular vehicle for adventure enthusiasts, as it is capable 
            of handling some of the most challenging terrains in India.

            <p id="para1">
                The Genesis G70 was under development for several years and was previewed by the Genesis New York Concept 
                shown at the 2016 New York International Auto Show. The design was penned by German auto designer Peter 
                Schreyer, who is also responsible for designing the related Kia Stinger. Development of the G70 took place 
                at Hyundai Namyang R&D Center in Hwasung, South Korea. The exterior design shares cues from the other two 
                Genesis models, the G80 and the G90. The grille features Genesis' corporate design, with functional air 
                intakes along the bottom and side. The LED headlights operate with separate daytime running lights. 
                The rear has an athletic stance framed by LED taillights and dual-exhausts. The interior's center console
                is constructed out of soft-touch plastics, leather & genuine metal accents that are slightly angled toward 
                the driver. The layout has three large knobs for the climate controls, an eight-inch touch screen, and a 
                small electronic shifter. Technology features include a 15-speaker 660W Lexicon audio system, 8-inch 
                infotainment screen with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto support, and a heads-up display. The interior 
                appointments on the G70 include quilted leather seating surfaces, along with brushed aluminum and stainless 
                steel trim.
