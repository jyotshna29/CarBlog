        <p class="carsPara" id="car1Para">
            The Nissan GT-R, is a sports car and grand tourer produced by Nissan, unveiled in 2007. It is the 
            successor to the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a high-performance variant of the Nissan Skyline. Although 
            this model was the sixth-generation to bear the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline line-up. 
            The GT-R is built on the PM platform, which is derived from the FM platform used in the Skyline and the 
            Nissan Z models.After more than six years of development, the production version of the GT-R was unveiled 
            at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show and featured the VR38DETT engine and other new technologies. The overall body 
            is made out of steel, aluminium and other materials such as carbon-fibre. The GT-R was sold worldwide, 
            unlike its predecessors which were only sold in a limited number of markets.

        <p class="carsPara" id="car2Para">
            The Toyota Supra Mk4 is a formidable beast and the JZ engine just keeps on going thanks to Toyota's first 
            class engineering. Many Toyota cars run great after 20+ years, not just the Supra. This is thanks to Toyota 
            actually overbuilding their engines, meaning that parts are made thicker unnecessarily to allow for better 
            engine health, performance, and reliability.
            Toyota's JZ engine was so good, that they used it in all kinds of different cars, like the Toyota Soarer 
            and Chaser, proving the engine's pedigree, and showing that the Supra was bred for performance. One of the 
            original Toyota Supra MK4 used in the movie “Fast and Furious” was sold for almost RM750,000 in an auction, 
            so it's no wonder that Supra's around the world keeps on rising in demand and prices.

        <p class="carsPara" id="car3Para">
            The Thar was first introduced in 2010 as a modernized version of the Mahindra Legend, which was based on the 
            Mahindra MM540, a vehicle that was in production in India since the 1980s. The Mahindra Thar was designed to 
            be a rugged, reliable, and affordable off-road vehicle that could handle the rough terrain found in many parts 
            of India. The Thar's design is based on the iconic Jeep CJ series, which Mahindra had been producing under 
            license since the 1940s. The vehicle was available in two trim levels: the DI 2WD and the DI 4WD. The DI 2WD 
            was a basic version that came with a soft top and no air conditioning, while the 
            DI 4WD came with air conditioning and a hardtop. In 2015, Mahindra introduced an updated version of the Thar 
            called the Thar CRDe. The CRDe stood for "common rail diesel engine".
